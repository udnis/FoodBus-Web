    <p class="main-info-text"> We are a non-profit organisation who help in establishing a viable route between Food Donors ,
        Charities and Community groups. Our vision is to eliminate the crisis of Food hunger and Food waste by routing the
        wasted food from Donors to Charities and Community groups. Our service ensures that homeless people , people in ashrams get daily nutrition effectively
    By preventing the dumping of waste excess food, we help reduce the food waste generated.</p>

        <div class="main-info">

            <p>India is a developing country. Due to Economic imbalances and fragmentation
                the society is divided into various economic status. While there are families very rich, there do exist families
                and people who are homeless and poor. They fight for their daily living. The prices of essentials like food, health,
                education, housing, utilities and transport have climbed so much in recent years that they are a nightmare scenario for them.
                Daily nutrition for them is very difficult and they seek the help of others for it.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Although the count of Community groups and Charities have increased lately , the work they do
                is getting tedious due to the scale of implementation. By providing a support for them to establish direct and real time
                connection with Donors, We improve their activities by minimising their effort.</p>

        <div class="main-info-facts">
            <p class="main-info-entity">1.3 billion tons of food are wasted every year.</p> <br/>
            <p>This amounts to US$1 trillion dollars of wasted or lost food.</p> <br/>
            <p>Just one quarter of all wasted food could feed the 795 million undernourished people
                around the world who suffer from hunger.</p> <br/>
            <p>Food waste in rich countries (222 million tons) is approximately equivalent to all of
                the food produced in Sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tons).</p> <br/>
            <p>Lack of technology and infrastructure is the main cause of food waste in Africa,
                as opposed to household food waste in the developed world.</p> <br/>
